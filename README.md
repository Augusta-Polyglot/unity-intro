1. Moving the player
2. Shooting from the ship
3. Breakable barriers
  * With prefab magic
4. Single moving alien
5. Hitting the alien with a bullet
  * With animated death explosions!
6. Multiple aliens
  * With a parent object trick
7. Score board
8. Make aliens shoot back at you
9. Player death
	* With animated death explosions again!
10. Lives
11. Win/Lose Condition
12. SFX
